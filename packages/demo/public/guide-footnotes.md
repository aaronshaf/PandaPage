**Eighth Grade Term Paper: Footnotes**

**1. What is a footnote?**
    a. A footnote is a method of citing a source that is used in a paper. The
       footnote should cite the authority for specific facts or opinions, as well as
       direct quotations.
    b. A footnote appears as a superscripted number at the END of the
       appropriate sentence or paragraph. For example, if I footnote this
       sentence the footnote would go AFTER the period or the quotations
       marks.^1
    c. Footnotes go in sequential order (1, 2, 3, etc.).
    d. It is not uncommon to have at least 3-4 footnotes on each page of a
       research paper.
**2. Why do you need to use footnotes?**
    a. Footnotes are necessary in order to avoid plagiarism. Plagiarism, as
       defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is:
       (1)"to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own: use
       (another's production) without crediting the source."
       (2)"to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product
       derived from an existing source."
    b. You also need to use footnotes if you paraphrase. Paraphrasing is defined
       as: “a restatement of a text, passage, or work giving the meaning in
       another form." Plagiarism consists of stealing both exact words and
       paraphrased words, as plagiarism covers the theft of ideas.
**3. How do you make a footnote?**
    a. In Microsoft Word, under “Insert” go to “Footnote” and the program will
       automatically add a footnote.
**4. What information does not need to be footnoted?**
    a. Common knowledge, such as a date of birth, or a basic fact that you have
       seen repeated multiple times does not need a footnote. For example,
       stating that acupuncture started in China is common knowledge, while the
       number of Americans using acupuncture would require a footnote.
    b. When in doubt – FOOTNOTE! It is always easier to remove them than to
       add them.
**5. How are footnotes formatted?**
    a. See the bibliography/footnote sheet. Note that footnotes are in a
       DIFFERENT format than the bibliography. Most bibliographical
       references do not have page numbers, while footnotes always do (unless it
       is a web site).
**6. What do you do the second time you mention a source?**

(^1) My ideas on footnoting.


```
a. If it is a book, you just need to use the author’s last name and the page
number.
b. If you have more than one title by the same author, you need the name and
title, as well as the page number
c. If it is a newspaper article or web site, you need to reprint the entire source
title.
```
**7. What do you do if you have a paragraph with several pieces of information**
    **from the same source?**
       a. You can put one footnote at the end of the paragraph, and put the multiple
          page numbers at the end of the footnote. Separate each page with a
          comma.
       b. If you are using information that is scattered throughout a large number of
          pages, then in the footnote itself write the word “passim” after the range of
          pages (e.g., 12-20 passim.)

**Example of how to footnote – a sample passage from a research paper** :

After the Civil War, New York City underwent a period of unprecedented urban

expansion. The population grew by thirty percent, to almost one million people in 1870.

Commerce, foreign trade, and real estate values also increased, and there was improving

efficiency in the metropolitan infrastructure.^2 The landscape of the city was changing,

with the rise of the central business district downtown and the creation of suburbs and

parks uptown.^3 In 1872, James Miller’s guide to New York City described its society as

“cosmopolitan – an amalgam, composed of all imaginable varieties and shades of

character... the rude and the reformed, the learned and illiterate, the affluent and the

destitute... all habits, manners and customs of the civilized globe.”^4

While urban growth created improvements in technology, communication, and

transportation, it also bred social problems. By 1876, 50 percent of the city population

lived in tenements, where crime and poverty pervaded.^5 William Cullen Bryant noted,

To great cities resort not only all that is eminent in talent, all that is
splendid in genius, and all that is active in philanthropy; but also all that is
most dextrous in villany, and all that is most foul in guilt. It is in the

safest lurking-places; it is there that vice spreads its most seductive and
fatal snares, and sin is pampered and festers and spreads its contagioun in

**Footnote 2** : This is a paraphrasing of information that contains statistics and facts
that are not necessarily common knowledge.
**Footnote 3** : Also contains information that was not my own idea.
**Footnote 4** : This is a direct quotation.
**Footnote 5** : This has a statistic.
**Footnote 6** : This is a direct quotation.

**Block Quotations** :
When a quotation is more than 4 lines long, it is customary to make it a block
quotation. This information is single spaced, justified on both the left and right
margins, and indented on both sides. A block quotation does NOT use quotation
marks.

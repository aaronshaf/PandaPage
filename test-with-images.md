# Testing Image Display Fix

This document will help verify that images are now displaying correctly in the demo app.

## Summary of Changes

The issue was that images were being extracted from paragraphs and added as separate elements at the end of the document. This caused them to not display properly in the demo app.

### What was fixed:

1. **Updated Types**: Added `images?: Image[]` property to both `Paragraph` and `Heading` interfaces
2. **Modified Parser**: Changed the parser to keep images within their containing paragraphs instead of extracting them as separate elements
3. **Updated Renderers**: Both DOM and Markdown renderers now handle images within paragraphs and headings
4. **Added Logging**: Added console logging to help debug the parsed document structure

### Technical Details:

- Images are now processed asynchronously but stored within their parent paragraph/heading elements
- The parser tracks which paragraphs contain images and updates them after async processing
- Images maintain their position relative to text content

## Testing Instructions:

1. Open the demo app at http://localhost:3001
2. Upload a DOCX file that contains images
3. Open the browser console to see the parsed document structure
4. Verify that:
   - Images appear in the rendered output
   - Images are positioned correctly relative to text
   - Console shows images within paragraph elements, not as separate elements

## Expected Console Output:

```javascript
Parsed document: {
  metadata: {...},
  elements: [
    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      runs: [...],
      images: [
        {
          type: 'image',
          data: ArrayBuffer,
          mimeType: 'image/png',
          width: 256,
          height: 192,
          alt: 'Image description'
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The key point is that images should be inside paragraph/heading elements, not as separate top-level elements.
